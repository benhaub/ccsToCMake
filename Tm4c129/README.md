Code Composer studio is not required to compile for this board.

First download the SDK for your board from the resource explorer.

Choose some example code. Any example should do.

Once you've imported the example, right click the project from the explorer and go to properties.

Select the gnu gcc compiler.

If the gnu gcc compiler is not in the list, follow the directions [https://e2e.ti.com/support/tools/code-composer-studio-group/ccs/f/code-composer-studio-forum/1473645/lp-mspm0g3519-how-to-install-gcc-compiler-in-ccs-theia](here)
